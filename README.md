# Hello-World
This is my first attempt at GitHub，It's just a small test of Hello world 。
I'm a novice at python, but I think it's a very interesting programming language, and I'd like to master it through continuous efforts. Hello world is my first attempt at GitHub. In the future, more and better works will be released to GitHub for sharing. Come on.
